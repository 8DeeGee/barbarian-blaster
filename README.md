# 🛡️ Tower Defense MVP  
This is my second Godot 4 project, created as part of the [GameDev.TV's Complete Godot 3d Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-godot-3d).  
I’ve expanded it with new features and polish to make it feel like a more complete playable prototype.  

## 🎮 What Is This?  
A simple 2.5D Tower Defense game, built in 3D, where you place towers on specific tiles to defend against waves of enemies.  
The project demonstrates a full gameplay loop from start to finish, including economy, building, and win/lose conditions.  

## 🛠 Built With  
- [Godot Engine 4.2.2](https://godotengine.org/) 
- Assets created by me using Blender 3.6 and Godot’s built-in tools  
- Gameplay structure based on GameDev.TV’s Tower Defense course  

## 📦 Features  
- 1 playable map  
- 2 tower types  
- 1 enemy type  
- Place towers on specific tiles  
- Switch between tower types  
- Earn gold to buy more towers  
- Background music and tower sound effects  
- Victory/Defeat menus with options to restart or quit  

## Additions Beyond the Course  
- Tower selection & switching system  
- UI to support tower selection  
- Background music integration  
- Sound effects for towers  
- Complete victory/defeat flow  

## 📚 Learning Outcome  
This project was developed to practice:  
- The use of Gridmaps
- Using raycasts from the camera
- Creation of proprietary signals and interaction in between nodes connecting signals to functions
- More complex relationship of separate nodes that exchange data in between themselves
- Dynamic instancing of nodes
- More in depth importing of 3d meshes into Godot Engine
- UI/UX for tower selection and in-game menus and in-game currency 
- Integrating audio for feedback and immersion
